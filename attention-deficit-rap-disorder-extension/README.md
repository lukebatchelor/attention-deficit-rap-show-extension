# Installing the extension

In your chrome toolbar, go to the triple dot menu > Extensions > Manage Extenions

Click the `Load Unpacked Extension` button in the top left and navigate to the directory that you extracted from the `.tar.gz` file (it should be called `attention-deficit-rap-disorder-extension`)

That's it!

### Optional

If you want, you can click the `Details` button on the extension and then enable the `Pin to toolbar` slider.
This will show the extensions icon in your toolbar and it will be greyed out if inactive and colored if its active

# Using the extension

When in mentimeter, simply hold shift and click anywhere on the page to change the font size. The size will keep increasing until it reaches the max size then it will go back the original size.

Note: shift clicking near text twice in a row quickly will select the text. I doubt this is an issue, but useful to know

# Can I make changes to this?

Absolutely, make any changes you want the script, you'll be able to figure out what most of it is doing. When you make changes though, just go to the extension in chrome and then make sure you hit `Update`
